im lost , she is suffering , her parents arent supporting her music 
she even considered donating her colours , i dont want her to lose her passion 
she is bright and talented , but she is feeling empty nowadays.
i couldnt even give her a solution , all i did was just agree to whatever she said and trying to motivate her  , though i failed to do so
i just want her to smile
i hope she turns out fine soon
