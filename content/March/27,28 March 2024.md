Haven't been getting a lot of time for writing these logs nowadays but I wanna continue this habit till August , but still when I think I will give her this , I dont want her to be overwhelmed so I'm kinda confused when should I give her this 
Anyways

Today has been kinda bad and good
There was a bad morning ,mummy se daat padi 
Still I talked to drishti a lot today and that made my day

And today she was telling me how she confronted an uncle that was looking at her again and again in the bus , she made him speechless

We kinda planned for our next date too 
Which miiighhtt be after exam 
RBSE Wale mc 

I dont want to make this really long but there is so much to tell 

I'm so proud of her

And if you're reading it yourself 

Know that
I love you and I'm proud of you
You're the best girl I've ever met in my whole life and I want to keep it that way
I just want to keep loving you
