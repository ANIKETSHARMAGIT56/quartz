i should be sleeping now , my head hurts a bit but i gotta tell you this 
drishti you are the best , purest , most cute girl ive seen in my whole damn life

she went to mandir today and wished success for us both , and she is just so thankful for the simple pooja flower , its just too much for me to handle it.
shes sooooooo cuteee

waiting for the next time i meet her , and we will take pictures too.
ill try wall leaning kiss with her
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
this girll
ive found an actual treasure
every night she goes to her terrace and shows me the moon and says "see youre just above my head today"
im the luckiest person ever

good night drishti , take away my headache in sleep
i love you so much
