Some holi happened , it was really fun ,but what's even fun without her , couldn't talk to her well these days , I've been thinking , what she would've been thinking ,what if she thinks I'm avoiding her , but like I know she's understanding , still it's normal to feel that way.

So coming to the good part , we enjoyed a lot , like a lottttt
We went to shalimaar . Met daksh and tahani 
It was really fun ,but deep down I knew something was missing and it was her , I really wish I could put gulal on her face that day.

I just want to meet her one more time , and say so many things.

Funnily, today she couldn't see the moon and I couldnt too , so that's an indication of universe maybe that we aren't meant to talk today 

Well that's it for today I guess , I'm with himank right now and he can peek into my phone at any time and see me writing this log 

So ig it's time to go for today 
Love you drishti and I love the photos you clicked for me
