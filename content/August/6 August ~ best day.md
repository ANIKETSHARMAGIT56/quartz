sooo she came back , she texted me and i loved it , she lost 6 kgs , damnnn , but i like her the way she is , i dont care how much your weight is , i love you , i always love you , anddd the terrifying shit is she got a pipe sticking out of her stomach , literally , and its gonna get removed tomorrow , and at least she didnt get any anesthesia dream , those dreams are fucking terrifying and confusing as fuck.

and im just waiting for my bday at this point , its gonna be soooo good and the day we meet , im more excited to meet her than my bday, i just wanna kiss her and cuddle with her , stare at her , see her smiling face , hear her voice , ive said this so many times even im tired of saying this again and again

JUST FUCKING COME IN MY ARMSSSSSS
I WANNA HOLD YOUUUUUUUUU

just 14 days to go right now , and im happy as fuck 

and i just watched chennai express yesterday , man i love its songs , they are so good , why doesnt bollywood make songs like that anymore.

so yeah now ill go sleep , good night my panda , take care and have a good sleep
