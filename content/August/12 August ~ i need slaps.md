so today , i sent you a picture of my eye , and i went like "i wanna precisely see the shade of grey your eyes are" then i found out , i was wrong all along , 7 months ive been in this delulu that your eyes are grey , literally i wanna slap myself so hard , ive been noticing every single detail about you these months , how could i , i dont know if im going crazy or what , i just dont know , im really sorry my drishti and i mean it , im really sorry , youre the only person that gives me this much importance and i just did this to you , and dont scold future aniket for this , hes innocent , and if you wanna do anything , just throw a kiss at him with full force , i love you my drishti.

and you know i just feel so good right now , taking out the factor that i literally fucked up hours ago , i feel satisfied and happy , i feel life cant get any better anymore , but i know it will , you will make it better , and yours will get better too , a lot better , just keep healing , just some days to go right now , you will be totalllyy fine meri jaan , i love you soooo muchhhhhh , youre the bestttt
and one more thing , i might be wrong with the color but i didnt miss the point that youre eyes are to die for , literally everything about you is to die for , remember that , youre not inferior to anyone , youre my panda

good night
yours and only yours , Aniket
