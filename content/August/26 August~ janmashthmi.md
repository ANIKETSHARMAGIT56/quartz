it breaks my heart yaar seeing you sad like this , you were so desperate to go to the iskcon event , but kya kar sakte hai situation ka , dont worry , next year we will be together on janmasthmi , youre the best girl ever meri jaan , youre religious yet logical , youre strong yet sensitive , every quality of yours makes me fall in love with you more and more.

enough of the lovey dovey stuff , im happy , i dont know why , i just feel good right now , satisfied you can say , keeping aside youre suffering , i shouldnt be happy , but idk why i just am and thats cuz of you.

its 12:05 im doing homework listening to prateek kuhad , this guy brings me peace every time im in a tense situation , i dont know why , his voice isnt anything special , but it just feels like im in my comfort zone , okay so net works now , imma go back to studying

hare krishna meri bachhi
today is gonna be , well , not fun for you so that makes it not fun for me
signing off
all yours
aniket
