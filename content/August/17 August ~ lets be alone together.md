so yeah ,my panda , youre totally normal , its normal to want to be alone on some days , its totally normal ,youre the best girl ive ever seen, youre unique and you never try to kill your uniqueness , you know thats the most attractive thing about you in my opinion.

so lets just celebrate the day alone together , youre the only thing i want right now , as i told you , i dont know what i want on this bday , actually i dont even want anything at this point , i just want you.

so be chill , we will go on a cute date , we will go on a coffee date , go to habibi (the STUFF) and then go to some park and chill , you dont have to say much ,the silence is not gonna be awkward , you can be comfortable around me , you can be who you are. and i think i can be who i am with you.

we are gonna do something for tahani , i dont care about other people , daksh , anjili , divya , they havent tried to contact me , i won't too. im satisfied with my small friend circle that dont only contact me when they want something from me.

so signing off , good night my loveee ,i love you 
yours and yours only , aniket
