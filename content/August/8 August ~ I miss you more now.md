soo your operation happened , im happy that it finally happened and your recovery will be sooner but still , we can meet on your birthday anyways ,and maybe we can meet 2 times this month , ill celebrate mine as soon as you start coming to coaching and then we can meet on your birthday. so it doesnt seem all that bad anymore.

anyways i hope youre fine , i know youre in pain , but dont worry its gonna get better , im with you , ill give you a tight hug when we meet , thats all i can do, but i hope it helps.

i often take things and people for granted , actually everyone does , but youre the only person whose value hasnt gone down even a little bit for me , youre still the most valuable person i have in my life , even tho we have been together for like 8 months now , call that a long time , or some might consider it a short time , but its been the most pleasant phase of my life , life sucks , it really does , i wont say my life stopped sucking suddenly , it still sucks , but youre there to help me out. actually thats all i want from a person , not even help , but that ounce of appreciation , that validation , that sense of value , that i actually matter in someone's life, as i said that day , i was afraid to open up to you because eventually i will find out how little i matter in your life , you proved me wrong. and im glad you did , i finally have that sense of pleasant responsibility and accountability , that at least someone is counting on me , they are relying on me , and i wont lie thats the best feeling i have had in my life. butterflies are different thing , but whenever i look at you , my inner self says "this is that one girl".

now when i meet you , i want to be totally vulnerable this time , i just wanna surrender myself to you , i just wanna curl up in your arms , feel your smell and warmth and just... cry

i dont know any other way of saying this , i dont know how to express this , but this is all im able to say in words

i dont wanna live shallowly anymore , i feel so suffocated for some days , i just wanna be weak with you , i just wanna talk to you.




and umm , tahani just broke up with yash ,i dont have anything to say anymore , atleast she wont suffer anymore , and ummm , ill go do my stuff now and try to stop these thoughts and distract myself
