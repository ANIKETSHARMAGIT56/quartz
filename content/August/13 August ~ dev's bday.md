so yeah today was fun and all , i took some pictures at jaisamand , ill attach them below , it was good , but aside from that , i miss you
i miss you so much ,im craving for you right now , everyday without you feels like an eternity , yet the fact i can talk to you makes everything better , though , its not enough , i wanna see your face , i wanna feel your hair , i want to feel you breathe near me , i just want you soooo damn bad at this point , im writing this at 12:52 , so its technically 14 august , but dont mind that

and umm , they say you find the value of something when its gone .
i have you , but still your value keeps on increasing and increasing , youre just the best girl every , my drishti , saying all this is getting repetetive , youre gonna notice this a lot , but idk what else to say , its just the way i feel.
