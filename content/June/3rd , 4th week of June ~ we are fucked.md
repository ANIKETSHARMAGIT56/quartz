This month has been a fucking busy one ,
But lol that's good , less material for you to read meri pandaa, waise bhi tu 100 200 pages ek din me padh jaati hai , this isn't a big deal for you,
Soo coming back to the journal, first I went to jindoli then I went to Jaipur , i don't even want to go anywhere , I just want to go to my home , relax , or go to see drishti , i really want her right now. I just want to cling to her and talk a lot,

Her mom found out about me , and told her to block me , which she did on Instagram , we still talk a bit on WhatsApp, just gotta wait for some days , or months I should say , until college starts and we both get our own phones , till then we need to be careful , really careful
