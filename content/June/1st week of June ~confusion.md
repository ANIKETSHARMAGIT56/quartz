Day before yesterday we met , it was the best day really , I gave her treat for my first pay , the feeling of her lips on mine is the closest thing to heaven that I can imagine.

I just want to marry this this girl

Also she is really confused about her goal , she wants to do fine arts in the end but she needs to get a job before that , her dad won't pay for her fine arts degree , I really wish she figures out what she wants to do before the fine arts degree to save up money for the fee , I really wish I could help her in this situation but I have no way to do so. I just want this girl to succeed in her life , she got a lot of potential ,but she cant find it yet.

If you're reading this , I believe in you meri jaan ,you can do this , no one can tell you your limits except youself.
Love you so much 

Your aniket
