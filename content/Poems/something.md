As I fall down her hair
That smile hits me like a stone
I just started filling my eyes
But she was gone 

Gone till the next lucky day comes
Everything seems shiny and bright 
First sight of her 
And my thoughts take a flight

My brain goes numb as I look
Look at her smile
Catching glimpses of her
Although I know she's already mine
