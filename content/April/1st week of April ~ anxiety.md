So I've decided to make this journal weekly

So on first April classes started 
I get this small window of time between class ending and drishti sleeping , 8 to 10 , it's kinda hard to maintain 2 conversations at once but keeping that all aside , I'm in love with you

Everyday you do something that makes me more attached to you , your smile , your talks , I love them and I'm just ahhhhh , I can't describe

I couldn't be more more thankful 
Last night I felt this anxiety that something bad will happen 
Luckily you were there for me to get me through the night , we talked till 4 , I didnt notice when the time passed 

Last night was good and bad both
I fall in love with you a little bit more everyday

Today we couldn't talk much cuz your House was full of guests , but it's fine, it's not a compulsion to talk , sometimes we got to take it easy

I wish I meet you at tahani's birthayy , ahhh we will take so many picture 

Ennaku unna pidikum
