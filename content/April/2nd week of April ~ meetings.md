when i look at her , she makes my heart drop 
when she touches me my brain comes to halt

this week has been so good but stressful too
drishti if you're reading this , i love you and im taking care of myself

so 10 april 
i loved it , i love you and kissing you was the best thing ever
when i was looking at you while you were sitting in my lap , i thought i want to marry this girl.
i dont even know what i will do if we ever separate

the imagination of the feeling of your lips touching mine or your body touching mine, gives me goosebumps

the thought of you gives me butterflies

and finally today 14 april

i just loved it when i put my arm on your shoulder and you put your head on my shoulder
i wanted to kiss you so much but i couldnt 
im just waiting for the next day i meet you i will kiss you so much

at last when i hugged you , i felt so light and relieved
