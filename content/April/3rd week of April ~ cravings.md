I've been craving her so much 
I just want to grab her and kiss her
She is just so much lovely and loveable

This girl has been so supportive
Last week she helped me when I was feeling anxieous at night

But I just want her to be happy at this point 
Though the relief is , she talked to her father about NEET and he said there are other options too 

They allowed her to choose any other option 
I hope he doesnt change his decision after this 

She gets really hurt when her parents make her feel inferior to others telling her she is fat or something , but I don't think so , she is perfect as she is , nothing to change 

If youre reading this drishti , youre strong , your my girl and you can do anything you want
And I love you so much 
Youre the best girl I can ever get.
And no matter how weak you feel , you're perfect.

With love - Aniket

I want to keep writing but I can't think of anything more to write. I'll write more next week my love , byee for now
