my tears are literally on my eyes
it feels like im relieved , i have courage now , everything i do finally has some meaning , some target , some cause

to sum everything up

# My favorite color is you

```
As she looked at my eyes ,I saw myself reflecting in hers.
i dont like myself , but through your eyes ,everything looks lush, youre the thought that always makes me blush , these tired eyes of mine , are they really worth comparing to the universe , that lens of yours , the beauty of your sight. thats the stuff that makes me smile every night.

i try to tell you how beautiful you are , as i think about you all day , having imaginary convos with you all day , as if saying it all is a child's play.
then the day comes , youre right in front of me , my mind goes blank ,i forget what was i about to say , instead of recalling it , i just admire your face , i wonder i could kiss you in so many ways , then the time comes when we are about to kiss.
this goldfish forgets everything and goes straight for your lips, not gonna lie thats the best part , but ill still stick to my point , talking to you is certainly a fine art.

im blabbering , now i drifted away from my actual point, now when someone asks me whats my favourite think to do , im gonna say its talking to you

but me who forgets everything , ill have this as my backup , if i forget this too , ill certainly say my fav thing to do , is kissing you

the thing that ill never forget , that is certainly you ,and if you ask me what my fav color is , i wont say yellow , it will be something new

that colour is certinly the one , the colour that you will paint me into
