## kya

	Kamre ke us Kone se dekhke tujhe  
	Sur Mila baithna ,ittefaak tha kya  
	Galti galti me tujhse nazar 
	Jaan boojh ke Mila baithna , ittefaak tha kya  
  
	Us din hamara mil baithna , mahez ittefaak tha kya  
  
	Insaano se hi darke , tere paas aana  
	Mera koi iraada tha kya  
	Roz roz mujhe aake , din bhar ki baate batana  
	Tera mujhse koi waada tha kya  
  
	Bhale hi na koi iraada raha ho , na hi Raha ho koi waada  
	Roz roz aake Mera haal chaal puch lena  
	Mai Tera lagta kya tha  
  
	Mere bina maange , tune duniya meri baaho me rakh di  
	Uske badle me tujhe chahiye kya tha  
  
	Maanga to tune kuch nahi , lekin Teri rag rag se waakif hu  
	Mehez kuch lafz chahiye tujhe pyaar ke, kya mai ab tak tujhe wo de paya kya?
