So it's 4:50 am currently , tab se padh raha tha mai , aaj raat nahi soya , parso raat ko bhi ni soya tha , idk neend hi ni aari , to be honest actual me dimag me poore time yahi chalra hai ki Teri kya haalat hogi tu kaisi hogi , tera operation hua hoga ya nahi , just get well soon yaar , I miss you so much , I miss you being normal , complaining about things to me , roasting me , calling me cute , I miss you yaar , but yeah gotta wait till you can talk to me , I'm really attached to you , I can't wrap my head around this , is this much attachment good , or am I obsessed , I don't know but I can say for sure that whatever this is , it's painful yet sweet and beautiful at the same time , you're the thing that makes it beautiful , you might consider yourself to be the most beautiful girl , but if you ask me , i would tell this with absolute certainty , I agree to it with every single atom of my body , seeing your photos.  
  
i don't think I will ever be able to love any girl except you , so yeah lol you're lucky in this matter , you're perfect for me , just the way you are.  
  
And um anyways , my back hurts right now so I'll just go lay down and try to sleep , and get out of my head , youre living in there rent free , I love you drishti , I love you so much. even tho youre mine , I still have a huge crush on you.  

Soo good night my girl  
Take care  
I hope your pain is better ,and you're sleeping fine  
Radhe radheeee
