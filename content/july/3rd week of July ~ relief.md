# Monday

sooo today i went to give her the test kit , and thankfully the result was negative, although we knew it already , its good to have some confirmation , so yeah now im lot more relieved

kit dene baad vinay aur tanishq ne samosa khilaya , and i think it was a mistake , mere haat pe sabji gir gayi , thodi irritation si hori hai , poora paseene se naha gaya 

# Tuesday

she didnt come online yesterday and now im genuinely worried , kahi kuch hua to nahi , she said that she will talk after she reaches home , i hope she is fine , and her mom got medicines for her periods , so i hope it turns out fine and she doenst have PCOS

umm and yaarrr tere bina mann ni lagra, online aajaaaa

all i can do is wait right now

and yeah ab tak is journal ko google notes me likhra tha , ab obsidian me shift karke 
static site generator se website bana li

its not much but i hope she likes this gift

and btw the graph looks cool lol
