I miss you  
I miss everything about you , your eyes, your face ,your talks , I'm scared , and I know you are too , be brave my panda , everything will be alright , it's a minor operation , you will be totally fine after some days , and when we meet I'll give you a tight hug ,and take away all your pain ,you're the most precious thing I have , and we will meet soon , I'll kiss you , I'll kiss your whole face , I'll kiss every corner of your face , I'll make you blush.  
I love you  
  
And mark my words , my panda is the best , the best in the world , I'll always love you and one day I'll marry you. From then , trust me , both of our lives will be perfect.  
I love you  
  
On the day you will read this , I hope you're sitting in front of me , and totally fine , and if we are on video call , or on text , happy birthday  
I love you, and on the day of my birthday , i don't care if I celebrated it with you or not , but the only thing I wished for , is to be with you for the rest of my life , till the day I'm sitting on a wheelchair ,unable to walk , till the day I'm lying on a hospital bed fighting for my life at the age of 80 in a coma, till the day I'm counting my last breath, and till the day my soul leaves my body. I'm yours and youre mine.  
  
But right now , I'm clueless , I don't know when is your operation , how are you , what state are you in , I don't know anything , this lack of information in killing me from inside, I can't message you , I can't do anything , I'm helpless right now.  
  
Always yours  
Aniket  
I love you
