Couldn't write the journal for the 3rd week , I kinda got busy so yeah I'll write for 3rd and 4th together

First , I love you meri jaan , take care of yourself , you've been getting Sick a lot lately , eat well , I don't want you to get weak , and right now I'm sitting in the train coming back to alwar , I can't wait for the next month when we meet , it will be so fkin good , here are some pictures that I took
And you know , you're the fkin best girl I've ever seen , tu chhod ke chali gayi to gand fat jaegi meri, I'm missing you so much right now ,plus I'm bored , side me ek old si aunty baithi hai , baar baar ghoorna shuru kar deti hai mujhe , itna pyaara to ni dikhta Mai , Jo aise ghurengi mujhe ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
