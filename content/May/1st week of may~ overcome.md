She is feeling unwell today , I don't know what I do I'm trying to comfort her but I don't think it helped

Tuesday:
She went to the doctor today , actually it's a big relief there isn't something serious, but the doctor told her to stay away from phone , it's nothing bad but my day just doesn't end well without talking to her and this uncertainty that maybe she might not come online tomorrow and we won't talk is eatint me from inside , maybe I'm addicted , maybe I'm obsessed with her , but whatever it is , it feels so good, it's beautiful , anyways ,the point is , I want her to be better soon , and continue her normal life ,I want her smiling selfies , her cute texts but who knows how many days it might take , I can wait but I don't wanna wait 

I want to hug her right now and tell her everything will be fine , but I can't meet her right now, 

This semi long distance relationship is another weird thing , I get to see her once a week , but I want to see her everyday , I want to feel her touch , smell her fragrance and hear her soothing voice. Anyways it's 11:41 I should sleep now , have to wake up early tomorrow

So good night my love avya 
Radhe radhe
