Monday

She went to the doctor today again and she told her about controlling nature of her mom , she handled it pretty well
The best thing is she planned out everything about her future , she will focus on 12th for now and then she will do training with her chacha and Chachi , if she gets a good scholarship in government fine arts college then she will pursue arts otherwise she will do batchelors in botany and PhD , I didn't understand it quite clearly but the thing that makes me so happy is the way she is burden free now , it hurts to see her suffer with anxiety , this girl doesn't deserve all this suffering ,I don't want her to suffer anymore , all I want is her to be happy 

Drishti if you're seeing this , I just want to cry hugging you , I'm so happy , I can't wait for the day I give you this whole journal , I want to see you smile and laugh, you're the best I swear , most perfect girl ever. I love you so much
